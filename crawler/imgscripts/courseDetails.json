The focus of the course and the assessment is to learn how to undertake a complete research project cycle from start to finish. In order to achieve this in one semester, the research questions chosen will have to be focussed and manageable, which the instructors will help to assure. The mentoring will then focus on the development of good empirical methods for the analysis - so that methods are learnt through the research process in each group rather than classroom instruction. Regular presentation meetings were the groups update other teams on their progress to also receive continuous peer-feedback complement the course. \nFinally, the results of the research will not only be kept \"inside the classroom\". Because of the interaction with institutions and actors in Bremen that will form part of the research process, students will get the chance to present their work to a public audience.

For instance, environmental problems and low product safety standards start to put significant constraints on economic development. The course will discuss various facets of Chinas increasing entanglements with the world at large. It will also investigate different aspects - economic, political, academic and other - of China going global.

To reduce their C02 emissions, many countries and regions are transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable sources of energy, including wind energy.

However, generating electricity from offshore wind poses technical, environmental, political and other challenges. Through cooperation between Jacobs University and the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) in Hamburg, students in this seminar will learn the fundamentals of wind energy as well as delve into the more complex issues and challenges posed by offshore wind.", "Credits": "2.50", "Catalogue": "University Studies Courses", "CourseName": "USC - Offshore Wind (Intersession)", "Course Name Abbreviation": "Wind", "Type": "Project", "Additional Information": "Course Appointments: \n1.

Most importantly: is the concept of a natural right of all human beings that precedes their social, economic, and political identities and entitles them to act independently an outcome of a specific Western culture or does it articulate an universal value valid in all cultures? Is it based on religious or on philosophical reasoning? When people claim their expression of thoughts and practices as protected by human right do these claims reduce cultural diversity or do they foster diversity? The USC studying Human Rights claims in cultural and legal discourses allows understanding the interrelations between global integration and cultural diversity in the field of law and culture.

Antennas are used in many different applications, where mobile communication is only one, although, one of the most important ones. In many cases it is the antenna that causes some trouble (dysfunction, disconnection, etc.) if not properly designed and realized (maybe you remember the trouble with Apple's iPhone 4 antenna in 2010). Therefore, engineers who are working in the wireless business have to know about the working principles of antennas. \nThe course is organized as follows. After an introduction (chapter 1) we will recapitulate the Maxwell's Equations (chapter 2) and the basics of electromagnetic waves and their main characteristics. \nThese topics are foundational for understanding antenna theory. In chapter 4 the basic method for dealing with antenna problems is introduced which is the method of vector potentials calculated by a given antenna current that causes radiation in the transmit mode (or that is induced if the antenna is receiving). The Hertzian dipole and the electrically small loop antenna (i.e., a magnetic \ndipole) are calculated as the very first and very basic antennas. After that, the most important terms and definitions are introduced, i.e., radiation characteristic (beam pattern), directivity, gain, efficiency, path loss, half power beamwidth, and EIRP. In chapter 5 we calculate linear antennas, here, dipole antennas of different electrical lengths. Chapter 6 is devoted to array antennas and the calculation of the array factor. Exemplarily, different array configurations consisting of half-wavelength dipoles are considered. This deepens the understanding of how beamforming, nulling, etc. \ncan be realized by so called phased array antennas. \nIn chapter 7 aperture antennas are discussed. For that, the method of equivalent sources is introduced. This theory is then applied to horn antennas and slot antennas followed by parabolic reflector antennas and lens antennas. \nFinally, microstrip patch antennas and patch antenna arrays are investigated.", "Credits": "5.00", "Catalogue": "School of Engineering and Science > Electrical Engineering and Computer Science > Graduate Level Courses", "CourseName": "Antennas and Propagation", "Course Name Abbreviation": "AntProp", "Type": "Lecture"}, {"Partial Grades": "Final Exam", "Name": "300411 Digital Communications with a Focus on Wireline Communications", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | -", "Instructors": "Prof. Dr. Werner Henkel", "CourseID": "300411", "Official Course Description": "Starting from basic knowledge in Digital Communications, this course will discuss Digital Subscriber Line transmission in quite some detail, still providing insights into counterpart wireless transmission schemes, such as WLAN and DVB-T.

Development of the cerebral cortex and behavioral outcomes are explored in the context of environmental effects that can amplify or inhibit adaptive capacity. Neural malleability is maximal in early development, but the capacity for change in the nervous system is maintained throughout life including old age.

It is the fundamental basis of applied biotechnology when it is applied to and used to study processes in the natural environment. Environmental Biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The growing concern over the quality of our environment demands prevention of polluting releases in the ecosystem and treatment of pollutants already there. The lecture course will deal with aerobic and anaerobic treatment of waste water. The most important part a waste-water cleaning plant is the biological part. During several hours of stay a considerable part of the pollution is removed by bacteria and the BOD5 (biological oxygen demand) is reduced by 85 to 95% during the waste-water treatment. Modern waste-water treatment plants do a good job for the removal of the organic matter. The problem nowadays is the removal of nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) and phosphate from waste-water. The essential processes are nitrification (i.e. oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) and denitrification (i.e. the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen). These processes cannot proceed at the same time or in the same place because nitrification needs high oxygen concentration (oxygen concentration above 2mg/l) whereas denitrification needs anaerobic condition (oxygen concentration lower than 0.1 mg/l). All the different aerobic and anaerobic biological processes that are involved in the elimination of organic pollution from waste water and soil will be discussed in the course.", "Credits": "5.00", "Catalogue": "School of Engineering and Science > Life Sciences > Undergraduate Level Courses", "CourseName": "Environmental Biotechnology", "Course Name Abbreviation": "EnvBioTech", "Type": "Lecture"}, {"Partial Grades": "Final Grade", "Name": "560351 Biophysical Chemistry I", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | -", "Instructors": "Prof. Dr. Mathias Winterhalter", "CourseID": "560351", "Official Course Description": "Interactions between molecules, such as antibody-antigen, enzyme-substrates, receptor-membrane are the base of biological processes.

This course will be taught during the summer break, preferentially in early June or late August (note that it is recommended that Earth and Space Sciences students who plan to take this course do their required internship between the 2nd and 3rd semester). In the course, students will be made familiar with geological features at various scales and with techniques applied in geological field work. The excursion focuses on geological sequences that illustrate the chemical evolution of the Earths lithosphere, oceans and atmosphere, water chemistry, and (depending on the region visited) the formation of metal deposits and their environmental impact. Hence, open-pit and underground mines are visited if possible. In the past this excursion took students to South Africa or Irland. Students are given the opportunity to acquire water or rock samples for their B.Sc. thesis project during this excursion. \n \nStudents specializing in Oceanography or in Resource and Environment with focus on Environment will participate in a regular 1 week field trip to the Banyuls sur Mer research station of Universit Paris-Sorbonne at the Gulf of Lions, Mediterranean. During daily cruises on board of our research boat they will learn to handle oceanographic instrumentation, analyze samples, interpret and present the data in a series of drafts and a final term report. \nOur annual observing trip to Mt. Skinakas observatory on Crete typically take place in June after the end of the semester. It is reserved for students who have just completed their second year of study in the major Geosciences and Astrophysics and wish to specialize in Astrophysics or Space Physics. Formally, students enroll for this course in the 5th semester after the observing trip. Here students will learn the basics of optical astronomy at a state-of-the-art 1.3 m research telescope. Students will participate in research activities conducted by staff at the telescope as well be engaged in their own observing projects. In recent years projects include the observation of Planetary Nebulae, galaxies and Globular Clusters.

Kippenberg", "CourseID": "610121", "Official Course Description": "The notion of world religions was coined at the end of the 19th century and refers to religions that are spreading independently of territory, language, and nation. Religions of this type emerged, when prophets rejected given social norms and propagated new values. Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism established a split between an existing social reality and a sacred and just order. The religious institutions of temple and synagogue, of church and sects, of mosques, orders, and temples preserved and transmitted that message; a corpus of sacred texts became the source for practical attitudes to the world; a class of learned authorities was responsible for their interpretation. \nThis legacy shaped these religions in the modern age. Constitutive to a modern culture is an interior rift. While the present age is seen as superior to past and foreign cultures with regard to technology and science, past and foreign cultures are acknowledged as preserving a value of their own. When philosophers in the age of Enlightenment levelled profound criticism against any trust in transmitted truth claims and favoured their replacement by a reasonable religion, they met opposition by other intellectuals who saw in the history of religions a manifestation of a power uncontrollable by human reason, but part of human existence. \nThe Biblical account of the redemption of Israel from the bondage in Egypt became a powerful metaphor for an enduring longing for redemption and for practical experiments with truth. New meanings of history and of nature were retrieved from the tradition that contradict secular beliefs in progress and rationality (Apocalypticism; Esotericism). In Judaism Messianism, Kabbalah, and Hasidism established forms of religiosity that had an impact on the culture and politics of modern Israel. Christianity developed out of Jewish Messianism and taught from its very beginning diverse paths of redemption from an irrational world. Islam emerged as a religion of a sacred community dedicated to common ritual practices and mutual solidarity. When the transmitted Islamic order collapsed under the impact of Western colonialism, new leaders emerged and turned a habitus of quietism into an active subjective religiosity e.g. Islamism, Jihadism, Salafism. Western colonialism likewise challenged Hinduism that became a religion of its own only in the 19th century, though its heritage derived from earliest times. Typical to modern Hinduism are the Bhagavad-Gita and Mohandas Ghandis practice of non-violent resistance against Colonialism. These new forms of religiosity derive their persuasive power from their ability to define the situation of human beings in the modern world.", "Credits": "5.00", "Catalogue": "School of Humanities and Social Sciences > Humanities > Undergraduate Level Courses", "CourseName": "History of World Religions in the Modern Age", "Course Name Abbreviation": "610121", "Type": "Lecture", "Additional Information": "This is a mandatory course for the BA program in Global Humanities (GH). \n- GH students take this course in fall 1 (semester 1). \n \nGlobal Humanities students will be given priority at registration, if places are still vacant these will be allocated randomly."}, {"Partial Grades": "Photo Essay (40%, Mandatory)\nConceptual Poster (20%, Mandatory)\nPresentation and Discussion of a Selected Topic (20%, Mandatory)\nAttendance plus active participation (15%, Mandatory)\nExcursion to the House of Photography in Hamburg (5%, Mandatory)", "Name": "610131 Looking Through the Lens: Aesthetic Theory and Social Practice of Photography from Modernity to Postmodernity", "Min. | Max. participants": "- | -", "Instructors": "Prof. Dr. Birgit Mersmann", "CourseID": "610131", "Official Course Description": "By bridging art, media, and science, this course introduces into the technology, theory and practice of photography.

It discusses the general principles of international law in relations to the North Sea Continental Shelf Case (Federal Republic of Germany vs. Denmark and the Netherlands) and the case of the diversion of water from the river Meuse (Netherlands vs. Belgium). The relations between international law and municipal law give rise to questions according to cases of the European Court of Human Rights and of the German Federal Constitutional Court. The subjects of international law are discussed focusing on the qualification of States as a subject of International Law according to the Montevideo Convention and on recent questions like that of failed States (e.g. Somalia) or on situations near to secession (e.g. Kosovo, Transnistria, Ossetia etc.) The principle of self-determination in the UN-Charta has played a major role in the formation of newly independent States and has influenced the development of the rules on state-succession.

From a Cognitive Science perspective, the study of cognition typically is construed as the search for those aspects of mental experience that are uniformly true for all. In fact for much of the 20th century most psychologists assumed that all normal human beings were equipped with the same set of attentional, perceptual, memorial, learning, and inferential procedures. From a Cultural Studies perspective, there is no avoiding the cultural framework within which individuals think and act. The idea of universal mental experiences is often rejected outright by many cultural theorists; every human thought and perception is uniquely situated within a very specific framework informed by history, tradition, language, social context, etc. The goal of this seminar is to explore the dynamic of both perspectives by asking which aspects of human thinking and judgment are universally the same or culturally shaped. \nIn particular the following issues and questions will be addressed: \n \n- Definitions of culture and dimensions of cultural comparisons \n- Methodological challenges of studying culture's influences \n- Culture and systems of thought: Analytic versus holistic thinking \n- Causal attribution across cultures: How fundamental is the fundamental attribution error? \n- Cultural differences in reasoning: Western logic versus Eastern dialectics \n- The self-concept in a cross-cultural perspective: Independent versus interdependent self-construals \n- Culture and context: How flexible are cross-cultural variations in self-construals? \n- Does thinking about the self influence thinking in general? \n- Direct versus indirect communication in different cultures \n- Characteristics of cross-cultural interaction: Working in multi-cultural teams \n- Intercultural trainings \n \nThis seminar provides an introduction to important theoretical approaches from both Cognitive and Social Psychology as well as from adjacent other disciplines, like Anthropology or Ethnology.

In other words, our feelings, thoughts and behaviour are very much influenced by typical contextual factors such as the living environment, the social structure, or the political sphere, to name a few. However, context also refers to other factors that influence how an object or a person is perceived, such as the mood, the expectations, the needs and the prior knowledge of a perceiver. Other Social Psychology issues of interest include how people interact, how inter-group conflict can be understood, and when people help each other or aggress against each other. \nThis lecture will review important aspects of social psychological research, which then will be discussed in more detail in 2nd and 3rd year seminars. These aspects include: \n \n- History of Social Psychology: A brief history of the origins of Psychology and the development of Social Psychology as an own discipline. \n- Basic concepts and methods of Social Psychology \n- Classic theories: Attribution theory, dissonance theory, and self perception theory, etc. \n- Person perception and social encoding: Which features are salient and which drive our evaluation? What affects our attitudes and our evaluation of people? \n- Person memory: Which information is remembered? \n- Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination: The concept of stereotypes and their consequences. How can stereotypes be changed? \n- Social inference: How do judgments and decisions change according to the social contexts? Heuristics and biases. Bad and good decision-making. \n- Automatic social cognition: Basic concepts, theories, and experiments on the ongoing consciousness debate. Are all our judgments malleable? Is most of our behaviour produced unintentionally? \n- Inter-group conflict and behaviour: How can inter-group conflict be understood and resolved? What produces it? How can it be prevented? \n- Social Identity and the self: How can the self be understood from a social psychological perspective? \n- Communication: Theories of communication.

We inspect the four major policy-making institutions of the Union - the European Court of Justice, the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, and the European Parliament - scrutinize their interaction in the policy-making process, and examine some of the policy outcomes (part II).

It charters the various German Sonderwege (unique, separate historic path) and Irrwege (meanders) from its late industrialization, failed democratization, the fascist catastrophe and holocaust to Cold War division, European integration, reunification and economic modernisation. Germany is interesting in its own right, as a leading economy and European pioneer, but also serves as a powerful prism of the dynamics, disruptions and contradictions of western (post?-)modernity. In addition, of course, it is the home to Jacobs University and its international students. \nOn the other and, the class applies selected theoretical perspectives from the breadth of social sciences to contextualize the German experience, including influential works from Political Sociology, Political Science, Social Psychology and Political Economy. The theoretical readings serve both to train students in their application as well as to elucidate what is specific to the German experience, and what can be generalized. \nThe class focuses on critical reading and analytical synthesis. Students prepare presentations, write several (short) essays and participate actively in class discussions. \nThe class is supplemented by a field trip to the nation's capital, Berlin, where students will visit institutions, museums and experience the flair of contemporary urban life in a once again vibrant (if broke) metropolis. \n \nFor students who are interested in a remote participation, a second group is available: \n \nThe seminar \"German Politics & Culture\" (Winterschool 2014) allows up to seven (8) students to participate in the class remotely via web-based video-conference and collaboration. Here are the details that you should be aware of: \n? Remote participation is strictly optional, experimental and offered for your convenience (for example, if you're abroad or in your home country at the time of the seminar). \n? It's remote participation, not an online course. It's a real-life seminar that features remote participation, not the other way around. \n? Participation is synchronous, meaning you have to log on in real time (Central European Time). Depending on your time zone, this may require you to be up at quite odd hours. \n? Remote participation is mandatory. The same attendance policy applies to remote and real participants. \n? There are technical requirements. You need: \n? A stable, preferably wired (not WLAN) internet connection, with at least 1Mbit uplink and 3Mbit downlink (also see: https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1216376?hl=en, https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/3367675?hl=en). Please use speedtest.net -- or a similar service -- to measure the bandwidth and latency (ping) at your remote location prior to the class. Make sure to select a speedtest server close to Bremen to measure your effective speeds. \n? Access to a quiet, well-lit room during class time (again, at CET). \n? A web-cam. \n? A computer with current browser and requisite plugins for Google+, Drive and Hangout products (again, see https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1216376?hl=en) \n? A headset wired to your computer. Built-in microphones and speakers are not ok. \n? Preferably, a second screen, so that you can browse class material while following the class. \n? Remote participation is at your own risk. \n? Please understand that neither Jacobs University nor the instructor can provide tech support nor guarantee service. You should verse yourself in the necessary services and be reasonably tech-savvy. \n? This option is -- for now -- open only to enrolled Jacobs students. \n? If you cannot effectively participate for technical reasons in more than 50% of the classes, you will receive a late drop; the class will be (late) dropped from your transcript. Any work or preparation you might have done, may be for naught. \n? If you cannot effectively participate for technical reasons in more than 50% of the classes, but missed more than the maximum allowed number of sessions, the instructor may assign you extra work to make up for the lost participation. This work may need to be completed promptly so that other members in the class can benefit, and may still require access to the internet. \n? You should register in advance. Spots are limited (8 total). \n? Please make sure you can meet all of the requirements and understand the conditions. \n? If you'd like to participate remotely, please write an email to the instructor at m.held@jacobs-university.de to sign up.", "Credits": "5.00", "Catalogue": "School of Humanities and Social Sciences > Social Sciences > Undergraduate Level Courses", "CourseName": "German Politics and Culture (Intersession)", "Course Name Abbreviation": "970161", "Type": "Lecture", "Additional Information": "2nd and 3rd year students will be preferred. \n \nThe trip is limited to 30 participants, and costs EUR 60,00 per person, covering transportation, accommodation, breakfast and entry fees.
